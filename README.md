Timetable Generation Using a Genetic Algorithm
This repository contains a standalone implementation of a genetic algorithm designed to optimize and automatically generate school or university timetables. The algorithm handles multiple constraints such as teacher availability, classroom assignments, and course schedules, while also ensuring efficient usage of timeslots and minimizing gaps in the timetable. By simulating evolutionary processes like selection, crossover, mutation, and repair, the algorithm iteratively improves the solution to generate an optimal or near-optimal timetable.
